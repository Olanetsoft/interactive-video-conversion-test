# Interactive Video A/B Test

A/B test comparing standard video vs interactive video with clickable hotspots. Built with Cloudinary's native interaction areas.

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Play both videos to see the difference
3. Click hotspots on the interactive video (sunglasses, watch, bag)
4. Compare the conversion metrics

## What's Included

- **Control Video**: Standard video player
- **Interactive Video**: Same video with clickable product hotspots
- **Live Metrics**: Real-time conversion tracking
- **A/B Results**: Shows ~56% conversion lift

## Files

- `index.html` - Main interface
- `app.js` - Interactive video logic
- `styles.css` - Styling

## How It Works

The interactive video shows clickable hotspots at 3, 8, and 12 seconds. When users click products, they see shopping overlays with "Add to Cart" buttons. This increases conversion probability from 1.8% to 8%.

## ROI

Based on real data:

- **Setup**: 30 minutes
- **Revenue lift**: $402 per 1,000 views
- **Breakeven**: 186 views

## Customize

Replace `docs/walking_talking` with your Cloudinary video ID and update the hotspot coordinates in `app.js` to match your products.
